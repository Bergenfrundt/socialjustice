        <p>
            After my experiences with this project and volunteering at the Sikh Temple, my opinions on the problem of poverty have changed quite a bit.

When I decided to go volunteer,  I didn’t actually decide on when I was going to do it. One day, though, my whole family was going, so I figured it would be the perfect time to do my volunteering for the project. Once I got there I realized just how bad poverty was.

I arrived at the temple. After going through the usual proceedings and sitting and praying for about 10 minutes, I went to the eating area of the temple. Here, I primarily expected to see mostly regular people just having something to eat after praying, but to my dismay, the majority of people were, in fact, poor people or people in poverty looking for a free meal.

I continued along with my mom into the kitchen, where she started to make roti, a traditional Indian dish which is a specially made type of bread. The entire kitchen was filled with mostly female volunteers, who were making Rotis, Dhals, and specially made curries known as Sabjis.

As they made them, other women would separate them into large buckets, or plates in the rotis cases. The other volunteers and I would then go and take one of these buckets or plates, and walk around asking every individual if they would like some of what we were serving.

With all the poor people who needed food, the whole experience was very surreal for me. I had never really met and talked to people in poverty or poor people in real life, and the experience, I think, really changed my outlook on poverty. Overall, it was a positive experience, and I definitely think I’ll do it again next time we go to pray.
